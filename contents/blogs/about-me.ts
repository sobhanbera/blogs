# About Me

**Hello, Geeks!**

I am Sobhan Bera

I am very passionate about programming and I love to learn new things. I am a self-taught programmer and I am currently working as Full-Stack Web/Android Developer for clients. I love contributing to open source. You can also see my portfolio website [here](https://sobhanbera.github.io).

**Tech Stack I use:**
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control. And as a time machine for projects.
- **React/NextJS**: Primary focus. I use react for web development.
- **React-Native**: For android development.
- **Typescript**: I prefer TypeScript than JavaScript
- **MySQL**: I use MySQL as primary database for major projects.

**Tools I use daily:**
- **Arch Linux**: This is my primary operating system.
- **QTile**: I use QTile as my tilling window manager in Arch Linux.
- **Neovim**: This is my favourite text editor. I advice you should also try this once.
- **Zsh**: The best shell I have ever used in Linux.
- **Alacritty**: My primary terminal emulator.
